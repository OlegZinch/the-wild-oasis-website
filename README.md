# 🌴 The Wild Oasis - Reservation System

## 📋 About The Project

Welcome to The Wild Oasis! This is a **customer web application** where users can view available cabins, make reservations, manage their bookings, and update their profiles.

This project has been a great learning experience for me in exploring **Next.js, NextAuth.js, Tailwindcss, Date-fns and other advanced techniques**.
